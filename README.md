## Resume

[Scott Rouse Resume 2023-03](https://assets.ctfassets.net/rtkhko6y3s3u/3TRFnxPz7ms3r8Ixnnpi0C/af37238bf57ba6a21ef47b5b81b43cee/ScottRouse-2023-03.pdf)


## Third Space
Third Space was a start-up focused on creating communication and mentoring opportunities for employees within businesses. I helped research and visualize the core ideas driving the application and business model and then design out a first iteration.

## Aha Notes
Aha Notes, a notebook and note taking app, was a personal project that I built with a team including an engineer, project manager, and marketing friends. It featured a patent pending physical notebook bound with a magnetic binding and a phone app that displayed a meaningful snippet of the note image as the list title.

## American Family Insurance Jutro Customization
American Family, a fortune 300 company, was migrating to a single, centralized insurance API across multiple brands without also systematizing the UI. Utilizing and manipulating their own graphics, I was able to illustrate to upper management the risks of not thinking about the UI as seriously as they did the backend.

## Summit Next Generation UX
This was done during my time in Summit's Design and Innovation Team. It was an exploration of what our various UI form factors could look like if we designed into the major use cases. It includes a (speculative) usage map informing mobile, desktop, and in-branch experiences.

## Summit Loan Member Visualization
A Summit Design and Innovation project, LOUI (Loan Object UI) was an attempt to standardize the expression of a loan within Summit in an effort to visualize that loan across various contexts of the member's experience. This particular visualization was designed to augment an in-person conversation between a Loan Officer and a member.

## Summit Content Platform
Summit managed their website with Drupal 7 which was nearing end of life in a year or so. I was asked to research alternatives and presented a content platform, Contentful, as a solution to break out of the silo of CMS managed websites. Summit signed on and now is rebuilding their website as well as centralizing rates, branch locations, and all product information in Contentful. That information is now accessible from any and all parts of Summit's offerings. The Contentful contact described it as one of the most impressive presentations he had seen.
